# Swift

PromiseKit comes with Swift and Objective-C promises. They are:

 * `Promise<T>` (Swift)
 * `AnyPromise` (Objective-C)

You can bridge between them both. For now refer to the <a href="http://promisekit.org/PromiseKit-2.0-Released/">PromiseKit 2 release post</a> for details. We will update this documentation in the near future.
